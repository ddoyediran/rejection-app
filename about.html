        <p>
          You only have to ask people for things outside your comfort zone
          everyday - it is that simple. Stick to it you'll find yourself winning
          a lot more.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="middle">
        <div class="rule-1">
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <p>Ask people for things outside of your or their comfort zone</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-2">
          <img src="" alt="" />
          <p>
            Then fill the form on Get Started with the question you ask and who
            you asked <a href="#">here</a>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-3">

          <p>
            If your request was granted click "Accepted" or "Rejected" if you
            didn't get it. Note: Win = 1 point. Rejection = 10 points.
