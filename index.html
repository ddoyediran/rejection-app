      <h1>Rejection Calculation App</h1>
        <div>
            <h3>The game has one rule: </h3>
            <p><b>You must be rejected by a human being at least once per day.</b></p>
        </div>
      <p>
        <strong>Why this app:</strong> 
        <em>
          It will help you to keep track and train yourself to be
          <b>comfortable with Rejection</b>
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What you have to do:</strong> 
        <em>
          You only have to <b>ask people for things</b> outside your comfort
          zone everyday - it is that simple. Stick to it you'll find yourself
          winning a lot more.
        </em>
      </p>

      <p><strong>How it works: </strong>
          <ol>
              <li>Ask people for things outside of your or their comfort zone</li>
              <li>Then fill the form below with the question you ask and who you asked</li>
              <li>If your request was granted click "Accepted" or "Rejected" if you didn't get it.<em> Note: Win = 1 point. Rejection = 10 points.</em></li>
              <li>Then this app will keep track of your score and asking activities</li>
          </ol>
      </p>
